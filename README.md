# New-Tab-Page
This is a static webpage created by me to use it as a new tab page in my browsers across devices. I have used minified bootstrap css for styling.
Procedure to set this as new tab for different browsers are given below.

###Chrome
--------
* Download the folder
* Go to Extensions Tab(the tab above settings when you visit the settings page)
* Enable Developer mode by checking the box on top right
* Three new buttons show up when you enable developer mode. Click on the button labelled "Load Unpacked Extension"
* Select the folder which was downloaded
* The Extension gets installed after accepting Permissions

###Firefox
--------
* Type about:config in the URL bar
* Find for browsers.newtab.url and set the url to "http://new-tab-page.herokuapp.com"
* Restart Firefox

###Safari
--------
* Follow the instructions as in the following link - http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Your-New-Tab-Page-in-Safari
* Give the URL of new tab as "http://new-tab-page.herokuapp.com"

Don't forget to customize this new tab page to the sites and pages you want!
